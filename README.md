VISTA is a context-aware work management dashboard designed to monitor GitLab merge requests (MRs). It provides insights into team hygiene metrics (MR age, update frequency, review status) and offers role-based views tailored for Product Owners, Developers, and Team Leads, integrating seamlessly with Jira.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Hygiene Tracking:** Monitors MRs based on age, inactivity, and pending review status with configurable thresholds.
* **Role-Based Views:**
  * **PO View:** Organizes MRs by associated Jira tickets.
  * **Dev View:** Groups MRs by status (Needs Review, Changes Requested, etc.) relevant to developers.
  * **Team View:** Provides aggregated metrics and ticket summaries for a team-wide perspective.
* **Jira Integration:** Automatically links MRs to Jira tickets based on title, description, or branch name, and allows manual association.
* **Context Preservation:** Maintains filters and context when switching between views.
* **Advanced Filtering:** Filter MRs and tickets by various criteria (project, author, assignee, reviewer, status, priority, type, etc.).
* **Dynamic Grouping:** Group MR data by author or assignee within hygiene views.
* **Team Management:** Select team members by importing from GitLab groups or adding individuals.
* **Caching:** Multi-layered caching (GitLab API, Jira API, Processed Data, Client-side) for performance.
* **Feature Flags:** Control the availability of new features (like role-based views) via localStorage.
* **Theme Switching:** Light and Dark mode support.
* **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile).
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Refresh data using `Ctrl+R`.

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The app will redirect to `/dashboard`.

## üî≠ Available Views

Vista provides multiple perspectives on your team's merge requests:

* **Hygiene View:** The original dashboard focusing on MR health metrics:
  * *Old MRs:* MRs open longer than the configured threshold (default: 28 days).
  * *Inactive MRs:* MRs without updates beyond the threshold (default: 14 days).
  * *Pending Review:* MRs awaiting review longer than the threshold (default: 7 days).
* **PO View:** Organizes MRs under their associated Jira tickets, providing visibility for Product Owners. Includes actions like marking tickets as reviewed or flagging for follow-up.
* **Dev View:** Groups MRs by their current status (Needs Review, Changes Requested, Waiting for CI, Ready to Merge, Blocked) to help developers prioritize their work.
* **Team View:** Offers a high-level overview with aggregated metrics (Total MRs, Open MRs, Avg. Age, Overdue, Blocked Tickets) and a summary table of Jira tickets with associated MR counts.

You can switch between views using the main navigation tabs. The Hygiene view categories are accessible via a dropdown under the "Hygiene" tab.

## üß™ Testing

The project includes unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

* **Run all Jest tests (Unit/Integration):**

    ```bash
    npm test
    ```

* **Run Jest tests in watch mode:**

    ```bash
    npm run test:watch
    ```

* **Generate Jest test coverage report:**

    ```bash
    npm run test:coverage
    ```

* **Run Cypress E2E tests headlessly:**
    *(Requires the dev server to be running)*

    ```bash
    npm run test:e2e
    ```

* **Open Cypress UI for interactive E2E testing:**
    *(Requires the dev server to be running)*

    ```bash
    npm run test:e2e:dev
    ```

## üê≥ Docker

A `Dockerfile` is provided for building a production-ready container image.

1. **Build the image:**

    ```bash
    docker build -t vista .
    ```

2. **Run the container:**
    *(Replace placeholders with your actual environment variable values)*

    ```bash
    docker run -p 3000:3000 \
      -e GITLAB_API_TOKEN="YOUR_GITLAB_TOKEN" \
      -e GITLAB_GROUP_ID="YOUR_GROUP_ID" \
      -e GITLAB_USER_IDS="ID1:ID2:ID3" \
      -e API_KEY="YOUR_INTERNAL_API_KEY" \
      -e JIRA_HOST="YOUR_JIRA_HOST" \
      -e JIRA_EMAIL="YOUR_JIRA_EMAIL" \
      -e JIRA_API_TOKEN="YOUR_JIRA_TOKEN" \
      # Add other JIRA_* variables if needed
      -e NODE_ENV="production" \
      --name vista-app \
      vista
    ```

    The application will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## ‚öôÔ∏è API Endpoints

The application uses internal Next.js API routes:

* `/api/mrs/{too-old|not-updated|pending-review}`: Fetch MRs for the hygiene view categories (potentially deprecated in favor of `UnifiedDataService`).
* `/api/users`: Fetch GitLab users (default team, by group, by ID, search).
* `/api/jira`: Proxy endpoint for interacting with the Jira API (get ticket, search).
* `/api/cache`: Manage server-side caches (clear, get stats).
* `/api/health`: Simple health check endpoint.

These endpoints are primarily consumed by the frontend hooks and services. Direct access is secured by the `API_KEY` (except for `/api/health`).

## caching Strategy

Vista employs multiple caching layers:

1. **GitLab API Cache:** Caches raw responses from the GitLab API (`gitlabApiCache.ts`). TTL configured via `cacheConfig.ts`.
2. **Jira API Cache:** Caches raw responses from the internal `/api/jira` endpoint (`jiraCache.ts`). TTL configured via `cacheConfig.ts`.
3. **Processed Data Cache:** Caches the results of combined/filtered data within `UnifiedDataService` (`UnifiedDataService.ts`). TTL configured via `cacheConfig.ts`.
4. **Client Cache:** Simple client-side cache for specific frontend data (`clientCache.ts`). TTL configured via `cacheConfig.ts`.

Caches can be managed (cleared, stats viewed) via the Settings menu in the UI (accessible via the cog icon).

## üö© Feature Flags

New features, particularly the role-based views, are controlled by feature flags managed via `src/services/FeatureFlags.ts`. Flags can be toggled in development using browser localStorage.

* `roleBased`: Enables the overall role-based view system (PO, Dev, Team).
* `poView`: Enables the Product Owner view.
* `devView`: Enables the Developer view.
* `teamView`: Enables the Team view.
* `jiraIntegration`: Enables features relying on Jira data.

To modify flags locally:

1. Open your browser's Developer Tools.
2. Go to the "Application" (or "Storage") tab.
3. Select "Local Storage" for `http://localhost:3000`.
4. Find the key `gitlab-mrs-dashboard-feature-flags`.
5. Edit the JSON value to enable (`true`) or disable (`false`) specific flags, e.g., `{"roleBased":true,"poView":false,...}`.
6. Refresh the page.

## üîÑ CI/CD

The project uses GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) for continuous integration:

* **On Push/Pull Request to `main`:** Runs linting and all tests (Jest & Cypress).
* **On Push to `main`:**
  * Runs tests and security scan (Snyk).
  * Builds and pushes a Docker image to Docker Hub tagged with `latest` and the commit SHA.
  * Includes a placeholder deployment step.
